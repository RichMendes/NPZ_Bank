# NPZ_Bank
E-Commerce website quickly thrown together in under a week. This project uses PHP, Bootstrap, JSON, and Java.

Limitations to this project included only being able to use flat files for storage. This ment that locks needed to be used
as multiple users could potentially access the same file as the same time.

Also, a B2B Client/Server setup needed to be created so that users could make Bank requests from their own websites/projects.
